# any body got a map? [üìç](https://staff.washington.edu/bryantl2)

A final, exploratory project by noted homosexual L.P. Bryant for Ben Lee (LIS598: Computing Cultural Heritage WI25).

<i>any body got a map?</i> takes the form of a zine, replicating a tried-and-true medium of homosexual communication, viewable as [an online interactive](https://staff.washington.edu/bryantl2) (recommended), and as an accessible, static file.

### setting the scene

<i>any body got a map?</i> explores and questions the role of mapping in exploring "queer" geographies. [Source datasets](4-FullVerifiedDatasets) for this project came from [Mapping the Gay Guides](https://github.com/MappingtheGayGuides), a project by Drs. Amanda Regan and Eric Gonzaba of Clemson University, in collaboration with California State University, Fullerton and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Mapping the Gay Guides visualizes information from the "Damron Guides," the colloquial name for the <i>Bob Damron Address Books</i>, a series of gay travel guides first published in 1964 by bar owner and amateur biographer Bob Damron. Damron's collocation and collection of homosexual folk knowledge, as well as popular events, made the <i>Address Books</i> a crucial part of the nascent American homosexual identity which would reach the mainstream in the 1960s and 1970s. Though he included indicators in his books for homosexuals of all kinds, Damron focused primarily on amenities and activites for white, male homosexuals. Ironically, he based his <i>Address Books</i> on the "green books" which came about in the Reconstruction Era South, originally designed to help Black Americans find safe community spaces and restaurants during Jim Crow.

Eminently successful, by 1988, Damron's publishing company sold more than 100,00 copies of the <i> Address Books</i> a year. The commercialization of the internet led to the shuttering of the project in the early 2000s.

#### a quick note on terminology

The <i>Address Books</i>, for fear of censorship and self-protection, do not mention any homosexual self-identification, such as "gay," "lesbian," initialisms, or similar. They are used here both to retain the historic character of Damron's intent (being gay himself), and the nature of those identities. Wherever possible, "gay," "lesbian," "bisexual," and "transgender" identities will be indicated as such and in those terms.

### scope & rationale

Given the scope of this project as compared to its source, only the fully "cleaned and verified" datasets published for the 1988 Damron Guides are used here as proof of concept. The 1988 dataset, despite being cleaned and verified, does not have its full dataset represented by the Mapping the Gay Guides project website, however.

The 1988 dataset was
